# Requirements for Scraping State Machine Pattern
#
# Note: This is a conceptual design pattern repository. The code examples
# are illustrative and do not require external dependencies for the core
# pattern demonstration.
#
# For production implementations, you would typically need:
# - selenium or playwright (browser automation)
# - Optional: pytesseract (for visual/OCR-based detection)
# - Optional: pillow (for image processing if using visual detection)

# No required dependencies for conceptual code
# All examples use standard library only
