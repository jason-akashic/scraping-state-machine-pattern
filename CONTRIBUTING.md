# Contributing to Scraping State Machine Pattern

Thank you for your interest in contributing to this design pattern repository!

## What This Repository Is

This is a **design pattern / educational resource**, not a production library. The goal is to share the architectural pattern and philosophy, not to provide a turnkey scraper implementation.

## How to Contribute

### Reporting Issues

- Found a bug in the conceptual code? Open an issue.
- Have a suggestion for improving the pattern documentation? Open an issue.
- Want to discuss the architecture? Open an issue.

### Pull Requests

Pull requests are welcome for:
- Documentation improvements
- Code clarity improvements (while keeping it conceptual)
- Additional use case examples
- Test coverage improvements

### What We're NOT Looking For

- Full production implementations (this is intentionally conceptual)
- Site-specific selectors or working scrapers
- Breaking changes to the core pattern API without discussion

## Code Style

- Follow PEP 8
- Use type hints
- Include docstrings
- Keep code conceptual/illustrative, not production-ready

## Questions?

Open an issue with the `question` label and we'll discuss!
